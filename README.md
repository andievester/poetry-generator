# poetry-generator


Have you ever felt down, and had the urge to listen to sad music to affirm your emotions and help you feel less alone in them? 
Or maybe you turned to something upbeat and happy, in order to turn your day around?
This app is intended to serve your needs in the same way, except with poetry. 

This is my first full-stack MERN application, and my first time using ExpressJS and React.
I decided to learn React after a year and half's worth of experience using Angular, and found it to be a fun and interesting journey so far.
This app is a small start to what I hope will become a much larger resource for finding beautiful poetry.
I am excited to share both my favorite poems and my programming skills with you, and I hope that you come back periodically to enjoy the updates and improvements I plan to make to it as I become a more skilled and artful developer!
